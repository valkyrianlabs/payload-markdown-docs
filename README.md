> ⚠️ This plugin is still in early-release as of v0.7.3 on 5/10/26. It is fully functional but missing a few planned v1 features like group parent slug level card grids of collections in that group for better UX, along with a fully thought-out navigation solution that natively incorporates with Payload website starter variants CMSLink. A fully featured stable v1.0.0 is anticipated in the coming days, by 5/17/26 at the very latest.

AI-first Markdown documentation generation, sync, and publishing for Payload CMS.

`@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs` turns a repo-local `/docs` tree into
Payload-native documentation that can be generated with AI, reviewed as plain
Markdown, validated locally, synced through GitHub Actions, and rendered in your
Next/Payload site with [@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown](https://github.com/valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown).

It is the documentation delivery pipeline for teams who want docs to move as
fast as the code they describe.

## The Pitch

Most documentation tools make you choose between three bad options:

- write everything manually and fall behind,
- let AI generate unstructured Markdown slop,
- or wire your project into a hosted docs platform that does not understand your app.

`payload-markdown-docs` is built for a different workflow:

```txt
analyze codebase
  -> generate docs with a repo-local AI skill
  -> write plain Markdown into /docs
  -> validate and plan the docs tree
  -> sync through GitHub OIDC or Ed25519
  -> render inside your Payload/Next site
```

The docs stay as raw Markdown files. The plugin handles validation, route-aware
metadata, syncing, publishing, and rendering.

AI gets the speed. Humans keep the control. Payload owns the output.

## AI-First, Not AI-Only

This plugin is designed around AI-assisted documentation from the ground up.

Install the Codex skill:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs install skill --codex
```

Then ask Codex to inspect your codebase and generate or maintain your docs using
the installed `payload-markdown-docs` skill instructions.

The skill gives the agent repo-local guidance for:

- documentation tree structure,
- frontmatter,
- `index.ai.yml`,
- sync safety rules,
- validation,
- route-derived docs metadata,
- Markdown authoring patterns,
- and [@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown](https://github.com/valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown) directive usage.

You can still write every document by hand. In fact, you should review and tune
important docs by hand. But the workflow is optimized for AI to build the first
pass, maintain large sections, and keep documentation moving with the codebase.

Codex support is included today. A Claude-oriented variant is planned. Until
then, teams can translate or adapt the installed Codex skill guidance for Claude
workflows.

## Why This Exists

Payload CMS is excellent for building serious content-backed applications, but
documentation delivery usually becomes a side quest:

- Where do generated docs live?
- How do they become Payload records?
- How do you trust CI to publish them?
- How do you preview and edit them without a hosted docs SaaS?
- How do AI agents learn your docs format instead of hallucinating structure?
- How do you ship docs from your editor to production without babysitting a CMS?

This package answers those questions with a boringly powerful primitive:

```txt
/docs/*.md
/docs/index.ai.yml
```

Your docs live in the repo. The CLI validates them. GitHub Actions or Ed25519
pushes them. Payload stores and renders them. Your site owns the final output.

## What You Get

- AI-first documentation generation workflow.
- Codex skill installer for repo-local agent guidance.
- Plain Markdown source of truth in `/docs`.
- `index.ai.yml` support for AI-facing metadata and raw Markdown exports.
- GitHub Actions publishing with OIDC.
- Ed25519 signed local publishing for advanced on-demand workflows.
- Payload admin collections for docs sets, groups, trusted owners, and keys.
- Next.js helpers for resolving and rendering docs routes.
- Drop-in docs navbar and headless navigation helpers.
- Raw Markdown route responses for AI/indexing consumers.
- Local CLI commands for validation, manifest generation, and sync planning.
- Rendering powered by `@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown`.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs @valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown
```

Install the same package in any repository that runs the
`payload-markdown-docs` CLI.

```bash
pnpm add -D @valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs
```

## Configure Payload

```ts
import { payloadMarkdownDocs } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs'
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  plugins: [
    payloadMarkdownDocs({
      auth: {
        githubOidc: true,
      },
      target: {
        enableDrafts: true,
      },
      sync: {
        allowWrites: true,
        allowPublish: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

This adds the `Docs Globals` admin collections:

- `Sets`: documentation packages. The set `slug` is the sync source and OIDC audience.
- `Groups`: optional route nesting. Routes are derived from group slugs.
- `Keys`: global Ed25519 public keys for local or non-GitHub publishing.
- `Trusted`: global GitHub owners trusted for OIDC publishing.

The sync endpoint is:

```txt
/api/payload-markdown-docs/sync
```

## Create Admin Records

Create a docs set:

```txt
title: Payload Markdown Docs
slug: payload-markdown-docs
branch: main
group: plugins
```

With the `plugins` group, the generated route becomes:

```txt
/plugins/payload-markdown-docs
```

Create a trusted GitHub owner:

```txt
owner: valkyrianlabs
limitRepos: false
```

When `limitRepos` is disabled, any repository owned by that GitHub owner can
publish to a matching docs set from the configured branch.

Enable `limitRepos` when you want to explicitly list the allowed repositories.

## Create A Docs Tree

A minimal docs tree can look like this:

```txt
docs/
  index.ai.yml
  getting-started/
    quick-start.md
  configuration/
    plugin-config.md
  workflow/
    ci-github-actions.md
  reference/
    cli.md
```

The Markdown files are the source of truth.

The plugin does not require generated-only docs, hidden storage, or a hosted
documentation service. AI can create the tree, but humans can edit it like any
other Markdown project.

## Install The Codex Skill

In the repository that owns the docs tree:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs install skill --codex
```

The installer writes:

```txt
.agents/skills/payload-markdown-docs/
AGENTS.md
```

The installer does not sync docs, call Payload, or publish content. It only
installs agent-facing guidance so Codex can understand the documentation rules
inside your repo.

A typical prompt after installing the skill:

```txt
Use the installed payload-markdown-docs Codex skill.

Analyze this repository and generate a complete documentation tree under /docs.
Use index.ai.yml, route-aware frontmatter, and payload-markdown-compatible
Markdown. Validate the tree with the payload-markdown-docs CLI when finished.
```

That is the magic trick: the AI does not just write random docs. It writes docs
for a known renderer, known metadata format, known CLI, and known publishing
pipeline.

## Validate Locally

Before syncing, validate the docs tree:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs validate ./docs --source payload-markdown-docs
```

Generate a manifest:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs manifest ./docs \
  --source payload-markdown-docs \
  --pretty
```

Preview the sync plan:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs plan ./docs --source payload-markdown-docs
```

From this package source checkout, use the local source CLI instead:

```bash
pnpm cli validate ./docs --source payload-markdown-docs
```

In GitHub Actions, `--source` can be omitted when the docs set slug matches the
repository name. The CLI infers it from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

## Publish From GitHub Actions

This is the default documentation CI workflow.

GitHub Actions signs the publish request with OIDC. Payload verifies the trusted
owner, repository, branch, and docs set before accepting the sync.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4

  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: 22
      cache: pnpm

  - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

  - run: pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs validate ./docs

  - run: |
      pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs push ./docs \
        --endpoint "$DOCS_SYNC_ENDPOINT" \
        --repository "$GITHUB_REPOSITORY" \
        --branch "$GITHUB_REF_NAME" \
        --commit "$GITHUB_SHA" \
        --github-oidc \
        --sync \
        --publish
```

`--sync` requires:

```ts
sync: {
  allowWrites: true,
}
```

`--publish` also requires:

```ts
sync: {
  allowPublish: true,
},
target: {
  enableDrafts: true,
}
```

This is the normal “CI for your documentation” path: commit docs, validate docs,
push docs, publish docs.

## Local Ed25519 Push

For advanced on-demand workflows, use Ed25519 signed pushes.

This is useful when you want to publish from your editor, local machine,
internal tooling, or a non-GitHub environment without waiting on a GitHub
workflow.

Generate a keypair:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs keygen --out .docs-sync
```

Add the public key in Payload Admin:

```txt
Docs Globals > Keys
```

Then push with the private key:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs push ./docs \
  --endpoint "$DOCS_SYNC_ENDPOINT" \
  --source payload-markdown-docs \
  --key-id local-docs \
  --private-key-file .docs-sync/docs-sync-private.pem \
  --sync
```

For immediate publishing:

```bash
pnpm exec payload-markdown-docs push ./docs \
  --endpoint "$DOCS_SYNC_ENDPOINT" \
  --source payload-markdown-docs \
  --key-id local-docs \
  --private-key-file .docs-sync/docs-sync-private.pem \
  --sync \
  --publish
```

That is the operator workflow: edit locally, validate locally, push directly,
and review the rendered docs on your Payload site.

## Render In Next

The plugin does not mutate your Pages collection and does not register public
frontend routes.

Add route handlers in your Next app where you want docs to render.

```tsx
import config from '@payload-config'
import {
  PayloadMarkdownDocsPage,
  resolvePayloadMarkdownDocsRoute,
} from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { getPayload } from 'payload'

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug?: string[] }>
}) {
  const { slug } = await params
  const payload = await getPayload({ config })

  const resolved = await resolvePayloadMarkdownDocsRoute({
    payload,
    slug,
  })

  if (resolved) {
    return <PayloadMarkdownDocsPage resolved={resolved} />
  }

  notFound()
}
```

This lets your app decide where documentation lives while the plugin handles
resolution and rendering.

## Docs Navigation

Use the drop-in navbar when you want the plugin to own the docs menu UI:

```tsx
import { PayloadMarkdownDocsNavbar } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'
import type { Payload } from 'payload'

export async function HeaderDocsNav({ payload }: { payload: Payload }) {
  return (
    <PayloadMarkdownDocsNavbar
      currentPath="/plugins/payload-markdown-docs"
      payload={payload}
    />
  )
}
```

The navbar reads docs groups and docs sets, renders nested docs navigation, and
accepts `classNames` and `renderLink` overrides for app-specific Tailwind,
routing, and analytics.

If you already have a site header, use the Header adapter to append top-level
docs groups and top-level ungrouped docs sets without exceeding your existing
menu cap:

```ts
import { appendPayloadMarkdownDocsHeaderNavItems } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'

const navItems = await appendPayloadMarkdownDocsHeaderNavItems({
  existingItems: header.navItems ?? [],
  maxItems: headerNavItemsMaxRows,
  payload,
})
```

The adapter defaults to custom URL links, so it does not require CMSLink
changes.

Use `mode: 'relationship'` only when your renderer understands `docs-groups`
and `docs-sets` relationships.

For fully custom navigation, use the headless nav builder:

```ts
import { getPayloadMarkdownDocsNavItems } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'

const docsNav = await getPayloadMarkdownDocsNavItems({
  availableSlots: 4,
  payload,
})
```

For simple flat header links, use the compatibility link helper:

```ts
import { getPayloadMarkdownDocsLinks } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'

const docsLinks = await getPayloadMarkdownDocsLinks({ payload })

// [{ label: 'Payload Markdown Docs', url: '/plugins/payload-markdown-docs' }]
```

## Serve Raw Markdown

The AI-facing raw Markdown export is a route-handler response, not a generated
Payload Page.

Add a `route.ts` at the exported path, usually the value from
`docs/index.ai.yml`:

```ts
// app/(frontend)/plugins/payload-markdown-docs.md/route.ts
import config from '@payload-config'
import { createPayloadMarkdownDocsMarkdownResponse } from '@valkyrianlabs/payload-markdown-docs/next'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'
import { getPayload } from 'payload'

export async function GET() {
  const payload = await getPayload({ config })

  const response = await createPayloadMarkdownDocsMarkdownResponse({
    payload,
    path: '/plugins/payload-markdown-docs.md',
  })

  if (response) {
    return response
  }

  notFound()
}
```

The response is:

```txt
text/markdown; charset=utf-8
```

The Markdown is assembled from synced docs records using `docs/index.ai.yml`
when present.

## Advanced Security

You do not need this for normal docs publishing.

Each docs set has an advanced security section for exact GitHub workflow refs.

Leave it disabled to allow any workflow from a trusted owner/repository on the
configured branch.

When enabled, add every allowed workflow ref explicitly. An empty list rejects
all workflow publishing for that docs set.

## Early Release Note

This plugin is in early release. It is fully functional, but a few v1-oriented
features are still being refined, including group-level docs UX and deeper
navigation integration with Payload website starter variants.

Use it. Break it. File sharp issues. This package is already built for real
docs workflows, but the v1 polish pass is still moving.
