<!--
vl-release staged changelog: package-facing changes for the NEXT release.
Maintained continuously while working; `vlr prepare` renders it into debian/changelog
and resets this file to this template.

Format: one "- " bullet per change (concise, technical). Indent continuation lines.
Optional "## Section" headings group bullets; if used, every bullet must be under one.
One level of nested "  - " detail bullets is allowed. Consolidate; don't paste commit logs.

- Parse numeric frontmatter values with strtod_l in the "C" locale instead of
  floating-point std::from_chars, which the macOS 15 SDK's libc++ lacks.
